## Stat-705: Advanced Design of Experiments

<h4><a href="https://github.com/myaseen208/Teaching/raw/master/2018-01-23_Spring_2017-18_Stat-705_Syllabus.pdf" class="badge badge-small"><i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;pdf</a> <a href="https://github.com/myaseen208/Teaching/raw/master/2018-01-23_Spring_2017-18_Stat-705_Syllabus.pdf">Syllabus</a> &nbsp; </h4>


**Learning Objectives**

* To impart knowledge of advanced topics in the design of experiments
* To impart practical skills through problem solving using manual as well as computer skills. This course shall help to enhance both these skills in students through assignments which would be solved manually as well as through computers

&nbsp;


**Contents**

Incomplete block designs, two dimensional lattices, rectangular lattices, balanced incomplete and partial balanced incomplete block designs, generalized lattice designs, alpha designs, Fractional replication, design resolution, blocking in fractional replication, First and second order response surface designs, Taguchi methods, Quasi, magic and super
magic latin squares and weighting designs. Latin square type crossover designs. Optimal designs (A optimal, D optimal)
